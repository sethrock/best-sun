      ### ***What is a Life Coach?&#xA;***


      ##### The reality is that the life coach industry is exploding. In fact,
      it’s one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Becoming a life
      coach offers you the flexibility to work whenever and wherever you
      want—while getting paid to serve others. You get to create as much value
      as you want while living the life of your dreams. There’s no other career
      like it.


      ##### So, why would you need a life coach in the first place? Simply put,
      coaching helps you identify what’s going on in your own brain. When you
      feel unable to get the results you want or feel frustrated with your life,
      coaching is the answer. A life coach can help you recognize where you’re
      stuck and show you exactly what needs to change when you can’t see it
      yourself. A life coach is like the best friend who will call you out when
      you’re showing up in a way you don’t want to, give you tough love, and
      believe in you way before you may be able to. They help you create the
      exact life you’ve always wanted.

    content: "## Holistic Approach at a Glace\n\nA holistic approach means to provide support that looks at the whole person, not just their mental health needs. The support should also consider their physical, emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing.\n\nEach person will have a different experience of mental illness and a path to recovery that is influenced by their age, gender, culture, heritage, language, faith, sexual and gender identity, relationship status, life experience and beliefs.\n\nIt is important not to assume that how you interpret situations will be the same as the person you are supporting. Listening, asking and checking are key skills to be able to provide a holistic service.\n\n\_A holistic approach focusses on a person’s wellness and not just their illness or condition.\n"
